# Movie Watchlist
**create custom watchlists for films on your forever growing ‘to watch’ list.**


I made this project partly because I genuinly have a bunch of movies that I want to watch scattered across different apps/notes and wanted a fun place to gather them all. The other reason was to have some sort of project publically available on github for my portfolio since my other 2 main projects are private repos.


Feel free to browse around the project's code or just head straight to the [demo site](https://watchlist.kabirverman.com) and try making a watchlist!
